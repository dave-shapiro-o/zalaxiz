This is my code for a top-down retro space shooter called "Zalaxiz".

The game is built with Unity, using free assets from the Unity Asset Store.

This is not a complete Unity Project! Only the C# scripts for reference.

It's very much a work in progress - there is only one level for now, which just repeats.
